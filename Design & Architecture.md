When discussing architectural styles during an interview, it's important to understand the key characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages of each style, as well as when to choose one over another. Below is a detailed discussion on some common architectural styles: Monolithic, Microservices, and Layered.

1. Monolithic Architecture
Overview:
In a monolithic architecture, the entire application is built as a single unit. All components (UI, business logic, data access, etc.) are tightly integrated and deployed together as one application.
Advantages:
Simplicity: Easier to develop, test, and deploy as a single unit.
Performance: Direct communication within the same process can be faster compared to inter-process communication in distributed systems.
Consistency: Easier to ensure consistency across the application as it shares the same codebase and environment.
Development Tools: Most development tools and IDEs are optimized for monolithic applications.
Disadvantages:
Scalability: Difficult to scale individual components; you must scale the entire application.
Maintainability: As the application grows, it becomes harder to manage, understand, and modify the codebase.
Deployment Risk: Changes to one part of the application require redeploying the entire system, increasing the risk of introducing bugs.
Technology Stack Limitation: You are often limited to a single technology stack across the entire application.
Use Cases:
Small to medium-sized applications where the complexity and scale do not justify the overhead of a more distributed architecture.
Legacy systems that are tightly coupled and difficult to refactor.
2. Microservices Architecture
Overview:
In a microservices architecture, the application is composed of small, independent services that communicate over a network, typically via REST APIs or messaging queues. Each service is responsible for a specific business functionality.
Advantages:
Scalability: Services can be scaled independently based on demand, improving resource utilization.
Maintainability: Smaller codebases are easier to understand, test, and deploy. Teams can work independently on different services.
Flexibility: Different services can use different technology stacks, allowing you to choose the best tools for each task.
Resilience: Failure in one service doesn't necessarily bring down the entire system; the application can continue functioning in a degraded state.
Disadvantages:
Complexity: Requires managing distributed systems, including inter-service communication, data consistency, and network reliability.
Deployment Overhead: Managing multiple deployments, versioning, and configuration can be challenging.
Latency: Inter-service communication introduces network latency, which can impact performance.
Data Management: Handling distributed data across services can lead to complexities in maintaining consistency and handling transactions.
Use Cases:
Large, complex applications where different components need to scale independently.
Organizations with multiple teams, each focusing on different parts of the application.
Systems that require high availability and resilience.
3. Layered (N-Tier) Architecture
Overview:
The layered architecture separates the application into distinct layers, each responsible for a specific aspect of the application. Common layers include Presentation, Business Logic, Data Access, and sometimes a separate Service layer.
Advantages:
Separation of Concerns: Each layer has a specific responsibility, leading to cleaner, more modular code.
Maintainability: Easier to update or replace individual layers without affecting the entire application.
Reusability: Components in one layer can be reused across different parts of the application or in different projects.
Testability: Layers can be tested independently, improving overall test coverage.
Disadvantages:
Performance Overhead: Multiple layers can introduce performance overhead due to increased complexity in data flow.
Tight Coupling: If not well-designed, layers can become tightly coupled, reducing the flexibility of the architecture.
Rigid Structure: Adding new features that span multiple layers can require significant changes across the entire architecture.
Use Cases:
Enterprise applications where separation of concerns and reusability are critical.
Applications that need to be highly maintainable and extensible.
Comparison in an Interview Context
Monolithic vs. Microservices:

When to use Monolithic: Mention scenarios where simplicity, performance, and a smaller team are important. For example, early-stage startups or projects with a limited scope.
When to use Microservices: Discuss the need for scalability, independent deployment, and resilience in larger organizations or projects with high complexity.
Layered Architecture:

Flexibility vs. Performance: In an interview, discuss how the layered approach allows for better organization and separation of concerns but might introduce performance overhead. Highlight how this architecture suits projects requiring maintainability and extensibility.
Common in Enterprise Applications: Layered architecture is a common choice for enterprise applications where the separation of business logic, data access, and presentation is critical.
Decision Factors:

Team Structure: Microservices work well with larger, distributed teams, while a monolithic architecture might be better for smaller teams.
Deployment Frequency: If the project requires frequent deployments and updates, microservices provide more flexibility.
Technology Stack: If you need to use multiple technologies or languages, microservices allow for that flexibility, while monolithic architectures typically do not.
Examples & Experience:

Be prepared to discuss any personal experience with these architectures, challenges faced, and how you addressed them. Real-world examples can significantly enhance your answers during an interview.
Understanding these architectural styles and being able to discuss them in terms of their trade-offs and practical applications will help you perform well in an interview setting.
